# Rust_Advent_Of_Code_2022
Title says it all


### Day 1 
A bit late to the party, but you gotta start somewhere. Let's see where this goes.

Got most if it done with a one-liner, although I am surely not happy with the way it looks. Weird that there is no n_max for iterators

### Day 2
It's going okay I guess. I think I need to tone down on the chaining stuff a bit, and start using it more when I get to know the language better. For now I will try to get to know the quirks first a bit, and try to use a declarative/functional approach when it seems like the right thing to do.
